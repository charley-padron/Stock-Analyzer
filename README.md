# StockScreener
This project is contains a small GUI and asks a user to input stocks they would like to research, seperated by commas.

The string of stocks then seperated by the commas to search for each one individually and retreive the stock's dates, open, close, high and low prices, as well as the volume and saved in pandas.

This information is used to graph the stocks performan from the dates available; later, the stock's Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are calculated and graphed on the chart. This will be done for all stocks inputed by the user.

The MACD and RSI are calculated using pandas builtin functions.
